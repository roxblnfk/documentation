In order for a function or method to run in the Workflow context (where itâ€™s possible to get the current Workflow info, or running inside the sandbox in the case of TypeScript or Python), it needs to be run by the Worker as if it were a Workflow.

:::note

This section is applicable in Python and TypeScript. In Python, we only allow testing of Workflows and not generic Workflow-related code.
