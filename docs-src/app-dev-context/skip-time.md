Some long-running Workflows can persist for months or even years. Implementing the test framework allows your Workflow code to skip time and complete your tests in seconds, rather than months. For example, you might have a Workflow sleep for a day or have Activity failures with a long retry interval. When testing this code, you don't need to test whether the sleep functions, as you can trust Temporal executes that functionality correctly.

Instead, test the logic that happens after the sleep by skipping forward time and complete your tests in a timely manner.

:::note

Skipping time is not relevant to unit testing Workflow code, because in that case youâ€™re mocking functions that take time like sleep and Activity calls.

:::

The test framework included in most SDKs is an in-memory implementation of Temporal Server that supports skipping time. Time is a global property of an instance of `TestWorkflowEnvironment`: if you skip time (either automatically or manually), it applies to all currently running tests. If you need different time behaviors for different tests, then run your tests in a series or with a separate instance of the test server. For example, you could run all tests with automatic time skipping in parallel, and then all tests with manual time skipping in series, and then all tests without time skipping in parallel.
